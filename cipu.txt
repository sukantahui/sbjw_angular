To go back to last desired commit you have to go to git hub. Click on total number of Commits. Click on your required commit link
and copy the commit id, above shown. For example, I want to back the commit where commit message is "updated-1 cipu.txt ". My command is

 -> git checkout 52c545bcc7fed94e11f489881f96e38555c566c0

Now your branch is head detached. And project is in previous version. Follow below commands before your next commit:
-> git reset master
-> git chekout master
-> git commit . -m "update with new commit"
-> git push


=================================**************=======================
git log (display all commits with commit id and message)
git log -1 (show last commit details;)
